1- Open MATLAB and on the left, find RUN_ANALYSIS folder. It should contain 
several .m files.

2- In the command line, type RUN_ANALYSIS(); and hit enter.

3- Select the video data that you would like to analyze. 

4- Wait while the program decomposes the video into individual frames.

5- Once the process is complete, the program will inquire about your data. Answer accordingly.

6- A window will open to prompt you to 
determine a threshold value used by the program to binarize the frames. Using
the Data Cursor tool, click on the image and use your arrow keys to find the value
of RGB at the edge of the worm. Pick the value that occurs right before a sharp 
increase in RGB values and type it into the command line.

7- The program will now prompt you to pick one of the images using variations of
the threshold you typed in. Pick the best image.

8- Wait for the program to binarize your data. Once complete, the binarized
frames should be found under the folder C:\FOR_ANALYSIS\binarized_frames.
